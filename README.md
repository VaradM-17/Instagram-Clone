# Instagram Clone

This repository contains the source code for a desktop version of an Instagram redesign built using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the Instagram interface with a sidebar that includes the user's profile, statistics, and menu options. The main content area displays a search bar, stories section, and a feed with posts, each featuring images and interaction buttons such as likes and comments. The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, and leverages CSS Grid for the post feed and Flexbox for positioning elements. This project uses modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and external libraries like Remix Icons for styling and icons.
